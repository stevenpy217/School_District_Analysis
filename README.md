# School_District_Analysis
### Python (PyCitySchool with Pandas)

## Overview of project
In this project we are providing insight and patterns regarding the reading and math test result in the city schools. Our task in this project is to use Python with Jupyter and Pandas to do the analysis. In module 4 we completed helping Maria come up with the school results for the reading/math tests. In this challenge we are told that the 9th grade data from Thomas High School is not credible and we need to replace this data with NaN. We replace the data with NaN and re-run the analysis and report the changes and its signifiance. 

## School District Results

* The change in the data for Thomas High School changes the result of the original analysis for the school district results. 
* The school district has a higher overall test scores with Thomas High School data now NaN. 
* Thomas High School percentage has gone down with the change in data.  
* Math and Reading scores by grade went up in average with the change in data. 
* Scores by school spending went down as the data was altered due to Thomas High School.  
* Scores by school Size has changed and increased Thomas High school to top spot. 

## School District Summary

In summary the changes in the data for Thomas High School has caused big changes in the result for the School District Results. The Math and Reading scores by grade went up, Score by school spending went down, and Scores by school size changed to the top spot. Using Panda function in Python allows you to modify the data and run analysis more effectively.
